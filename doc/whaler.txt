 1. INTRODUCTION                                      *whaler-introduction*

**Whaler** is a neovim telescope plugin extension that allows telescope user to move blazingly fast between directories.

It is based on the concept of [tmux-windowizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-windowizer) from [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) which uses a set of directories and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to move to another directory in a new tmux session.

**Whaler** offers a fast experience to move between projects without much hassle.


**Whaler** does primarly the following things:
1. Looks for subdirectories in a set of directories passed as arguments.
2. Fuzzy finds among the subdirectories
3. Once a directory is selected it automatically changes the vim `cwd` to the selected directory.
4. Automatically opens the desired file explorer.

 2. QUICKSTART                                        *whaler-quickstart*

**Whaler** is a neovim telescope plugin extension.

#### Dependencies

- [Neovim (v0.9.0)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.9.0)
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

#### Installation guide

It is recommended to put `whaler` as a Telescope dependency.

Using **lazy**:
```lua
return {
    "SalOrak/whaler"
}
```

 3. USAGE                                             *whaler-usage*

 Whaler does not have any **mappings** by default. It is up to you to create any mappings.

In the Telescope configuration file:
```lua
-- Telescope setup()
local telescope = require('telescope')

telescope.setup({
    -- Your telescope setup here...
    extensions = {
        whaler = {
            -- Whaler configuration
        }
    }
})
-- More config here
telescope.load_extension("whaler")
--

-- Open whaler using <leader>fw
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>fw", function()
    local w = telescope.extensions.whaler.whaler
    w({
        -- Telescope theme settings here
    })
 end,)

-- Or directly
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>fw", telescope.extensions.whaler.whaler)

```

==============================================================================
 4. CUSTOMIZATION                                     *whaler-customization*

Whaler supports a few configuration options.
Here is the list of a default configuration:

```lua
whaler = {
    -- Absolute path directories to search. By default the list is empty. A folder path may be
    -- prefixed with a `=` to add a single directory instead of searching it for subdirectories.
    directories = { "/home/user/projects", "/home/user/work", "=/path/to/single/folder"}, 
    auto_file_explorer = true, -- Whether to automatically open file explorer. By default is `true`
    auto_cwd = true, -- Whether to automatically change current working directory. By default is `true`
    file_explorer = "netrw", -- Automagically creates a configuration for the file explorer of your choice. 
                             -- Options are "netrw"(default), "nvimtree", "neotree", "oil", "telescope_file_browser".
    file_explorer_config = { -- (OPTIONAL) Map to configure what command is triggered by which plugin. 
                             -- For basic configuration this is done automatically setting up the file_explorer config.
        plugin_name = "netrw", -- Plugin. Should be installed.
        command = "Explorer", -- The plugin command to open.
                              -- Command must accept a path as parameter
        prefix_dir = " ",     -- Prefix string to be appended after the command and before the directory path. 
                              -- Example: In the `telescope_file_browser` the value is ` path=`.
                              --          The final command is `Telescope file_browser path=/path/to/dir`.
                              -- By default is " " (space)
    },
    theme = {                -- Telescope theme default Whaler options.
        results_title = false,
        layout_strategy = "center",
        previewer = false,
        layout_config = {
            height =  0.3,
            width = 0.4
        },
        sorting_strategy = "ascending",
        border = true,
    } 
}
```
By default `Whaler.nvim` changes the current working directory (*cwd*) to the selected directory AND opens the file explorer (`netrw` by default). 

Changing `auto_cwd` to `false` will make Whaler to only open the file explorer in the selected directory while maintaining the previous current working directory.

Changing `auto_file_explorer` to `false` while keeping `auto_cwd` enabled will make Whaler to change the current working directory to the selected one but without losing the current file. 

**Attention!**: Setting both `auto_cwd` and `auto_file_explorer` to false will make Whaler almost useless as it won't affect to anything.

The `file_explorer` is a shortcut that automatically create a `file_explorer_config` with some basics commands. You can, for example, use the default `netrw` but instead of using `Explore` you can split it using `VExplore`. To do the whaler setup config should be like
```lua
whaler = {
    -- Some config here
    file_explorer_config = {
        plugin_name = "netrw", -- Plugin name.
        command = "Vexplore", -- Vertical file explorer command
        prefix_dir = " ", -- (Optional) By default is space.
    },
}
```

 5. SUPPORTED FILE EXPLORERS                         *whaler-supported-file-explorers*

Currently the following file explorers are supported out of the box:
- [netrw](): Default and fallback option.
- [Neo-Tree](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim). Does not require any configuration.
- [Oil](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim). Does not require any configuration.
- [Nvim-Tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua). To work as intended add `sync_root_with_cwd = true` in the `nvim-tree` setup function.
- [Telescope-file-browser](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-file-browser.nvim). Does not require any configuration.
